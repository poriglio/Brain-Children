Midterm Project Proposal : Character Reference Sheet Builder

Solves problems for writers!

	- keep details about characters consistent
		+ details such as eye color, hair color, birthday, etc are easy
		  to forget while writing longer stories/novels

	- develop characters and plot
		+ built in templates encourage writers to think in more depth 
		  about their characters by asking probing questions
			- what is his/her favorite food and why?
			- what teacher had an impact on his life?
			- how does he interact with strangers?

	- act as easy reference to give to others
		+ roleplayers 
			- others in a role-play should have easy access to important details
		+ commissioners
			- if you commission someone to write a story about your character, a ref sheet
			  acts as an easy way to communicate important details

Functionality

	Nested Organization
	
		Universe or Story
			Character
				Ref Sheet - each character can have multiple

		Ref Sheets
			Built In ———— Custom ——— Revised
	

	Creating a new ref sheet

		User starts with some set number of fields (perhaps five) and can add, delete,
		and edit them from there
	

	Reference Sheet Templates
		
		Basic Info 
			birthday, location, age, etc

		Physical characteristics
			hair, eye color, tattoos, scars, etc
			 
		Relationships
			parents, siblings, family, friends, lovers, past friends and lovers, coworkers, bosses


	Edit-in-place
		
		User can delete or add a new field at any point in the list of fields
		
		User can change the size of any field (small, medium, large)


	Saving - 
		
		A reference sheet can be saved at any point as either…
			1. a template to use in the future
			2. a filled-out sheet for a specific character
		
		
	
	Technologies used
		
		Bootstrap (but it’ll look way cooler because I love designing!)
		
		Interactivity

			DOM manipulation
			Adding/removing elements
			Click event handling
			Form building
		
		Object-Oriented Programming
			
			Each field in a template will be an object in an array, whether it is a template
			or a full sheet.

			var basicInfoArray = [ 

				{
					fieldName    : “fieldName”,
					fieldContent : “fieldContent”,
					fieldSize    : “size” - small, medium, or large
				}

				]
			
			Each character will contain a list of arrays (completed forms) and each 
			world/story will contain a list of characters.

			When a new sheet is created for a character,
			that character’s name is used as the prototype for each object in the sheet.
	
			Similarly, the name of the world/novel will be the prototype for each sheet
			that takes place in that world.
